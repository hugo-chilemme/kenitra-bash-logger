# Bash Controller Script 🚀

This script allows you to log connections and commands typed in real-time. 📝

## Context 📚

You can track the commands executed by users on your server. However, generic usernames like `root` or shared accounts can pose a problem as you cannot identify the actual user.

## Instructions 📋
